Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.\r\n\r\n7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.\r\n\r\nIn essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you\'ll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you\'ve already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.\r\n\r\nThough the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3‚Äì7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.\r\n', 8, '32', '2-7', 30, 10, 'Bauza, Antoine', 'Repos Production'),

Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.\r\n\r\nDuring a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: \"Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?\" or \"Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?\" Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.', 4, '15', '2-5', 45, 8, 'Wrede, Klaus-Jurgen', 'Hans im Gluck'),
(28, 'Catan', '\r\n\r\nIn Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)‚Äîwood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone‚Äîto build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.\r\n\r\nSetup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\r\n\r\nA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities‚Äîthink: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\r\n\r\nPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\r\n\r\nCatan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\r\n\r\nDie Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector\'s edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

All pictures are shown face up and every player has to bet upon which picture was the storyteller\'s.\r\n\r\nIf nobody or everybody finds the correct card, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 2. Otherwise the storyteller and whoever found the correct answer score 3. Players score 1 point for every vote for their own card.\r\n\r\nThe game ends when the deck is empty or if a player scores 30 points. In either case, the player with the most points wins the game.\r\n\r\nThe base game and all expansions have 84 cards each.\r\n', 9, '26', '3-6', 30, 6, 'Roubira, Jean-Louis', 'ADC Blackfire Entertainment'),

Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!\r\n\r\nOn each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go \"into decline\". A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.\r\n\r\nAt the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.', 2, '24', '2-5', 90, 8, 'Keyaerts, Philippe', 'Days of Wonder');
